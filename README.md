Kog

An extremely opinionated javascript web framework.

The Zen of Kog.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it
Boilerplate should be abstracted.
Builds should be abstracted.
Things not required to create your app should be abstracted.
Development tools should be implicit.
Modules, components and container creation should be automated.
Builds are too slow for development.
The W3C standard is correct. Lets only use that.
More time should be spent on your app than setup.

Server:
Express is the best backend framework.
Mongoose is the best ORM.

Client:
React is the best frontend framework.
Redux is even better.

Routes:
React-Router is amazing.  Isomorphic javascript will help.

Development:
Webpack is the best for react.
Babel is the closest to the W3C standard.
Browser Sync is the best, because of multi-device reloading.

Testing
Mocha.






Commands:
Run Production Server: NODE_ENV=production npm start
Use this and not start:prod because it actually sets the NODE_ENV=production
and some of the files rely on process.env.NODE_ENV (debug)
